# **Build A Bet** [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](#isc-license)
---

## Overview
---
**Build A Bet** is a webpage application powered by dynamic ```JavaScript``` via a "back-end" structure utilizing ```REACT.js``` with dependencies on ```MongoDB```, ```Mongoose```, ```GraphQL```, and ```Apollo``` for data maintenance, storage and queries. Additionally, the client-side will feature a user-friendly and intuitive experience by incorporating an ```HTML``` back-bone strongly supported by the ```REACT.js``` build technology.

This application allows users to access game-odds for sports and build their own parlay picks linked to their own user accounts. Furthermore, the site will feature secure login technology via ```JSONwebtokens``` combined with ```Bcrypt``` password encryption ,in order to ensure safe transactions and secured data.

Overall, **Build A Bet**  follows the ```MERN``` concept referencing "full-stack" development with a ```JavaScript``` powered "back-end" and a dynamic "front-end" rendered using ```REACT.js```. All of these combined languages and processes create the unique user experience while visiting the application's pages deployed via ```Heroku```.
